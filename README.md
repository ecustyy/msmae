Modality-specificity multi-aware evidence fusion algorithm using CFP and OCT for fundus diseases diagnosis

There are two modalities, each of which uses separate branches. The diagnostic results are fused in the decision branch.

CFP branch:
MSAS-ViT: cfp_mask_train.py (train); cfp_mask_test.py (test);
Graph-ViT: cfp_graph_train.py (train); cfp_graph_test.py (test);

OCT branch:
MSAS-ViT: oct_mask_train.py (train); oct_mask_test.py (test);
Graph-ViT: oct_graph_train.py (train); oct_graph_test.py (test);
